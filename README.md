# Group Gifts

This is a React SPA with TypeScript project using Firebase/Firestore as the backend, ultimately hosted on Firebase(rather than GH Pages for a change).
The main purpose of this app is to allow you and a group of friends or family to create wish lists for yourselves and help eachother complete those lists.
It is relatively simple in function and needs a lot of work, but the current commits reflect a solid v1.0

## Styles

I used [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for styling

## Future Goals

-   It would be great to implement a chat system using Firebase Realtime Database
-   Tidy up the code base, there is a good deal of different philosophies/strategies/approaches used especially with regards to TypeScript
-   In order to have access to the app, you need admin approval (aka from me). With this in mind, I need to build some sort of admin dashboard to accept new users
-   Ultimately I'd like to make the application a bit more self-sufficient but frankly I haven't given it much thought yet.
-   I need to rethink the models a bit, things can get complicated with collections/subcollections pretty quickly so I am not entirely satisfied with the current set up.

## This project was initially scaffolded using a [great Firebase boilerplate project](https://github.com/SamuelPinho/react-firebase-auth-boilerplate)

Props to the work over there for this great starting point, which really takes a lot of the heavy lifting in the beginning out of the way.
